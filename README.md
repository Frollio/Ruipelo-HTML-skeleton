# Ruipelo HTML skeleton

Ruipelo is a simple HTML5 skeleton template. I did it for my personal use but other people are free to use it too.

## Some notes about using Ruipelo

### lang="fi"

By the moment the chosen language is Finnish. Change it if you wish to use any other language. English would be "en".

### normalize.css

If you use normalize.css you need to download it first. You can get it from Nicolas Gallagher: https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/.

### Font Awesome

The Font Awesome kit link in the <head> won't work on your site. Get your own link from here: https://fontawesome.com/.

### CSS Classes

The CSS classes navigation-bar and navigation-menu don't exist right now. Remove them or rename them if you wish.
